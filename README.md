# Project and Portfolio 3
## Application Description
I havent decided yet.

### Installation
```
npm install
npm start
```

## Errors:
### Public Folder: 
- [] Update favicon.ico to match project
- [] index.html - line 27 -  change page title to match project.
- [] Replace logo192.png and logo512.png - change to match project.
- [] Update the manifest.json to match project.
### Src Folder: 
- []
- [] All file names: Remove .jsx Replace with .js  || x in file name is not needed. 
- [] Remove styles folder. Not good method.  Keep css with components if using CSS files. However it is slower.
- [] Notifications.js needs to be move to the pages folder.
- [] Remove unused code from index.css
- [] Delete logo.svg
- [] Delete AvatarComponent.js - it is not needed.
- [] React Routing. Routing.js needs to be deleted. That is old vs.5 routing.
- [] Either use semi-colons or don't use semi-colons but don't do both.
- [] No warnings or errors in terminal
- [] Create a folder for the all of the cards.
- []
- []


## Correct:
- [] They can use any style library. However, React prefers CSS-in-JS
